Codes are separeted by METHOD.

All of them were used for a subject I took for Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (2019) called "Computational methods in Physics I".

Most of them have descriptions in portuguese. Sorry :(. Hope I can upgrade them eventually in english.

They are very usable. Simple codes, but some fun algorithms behind. Don't be afraid to download and play with them trying using new functions.

I hope you enjoy! :D
